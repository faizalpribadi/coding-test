# Coding Challenge: Sales Dashboard with Next.js & FastAPI

## Overview
Your task is to build a simple, full-stack application featuring:
1. **Next.js** as the frontend framework.
2. **FastAPI** as the backend API layer.
3. **Dummy JSON Data** (provided) with sales-related information.
4. **Fiber** as additional backend with golang 

## Generate Information 
The architecture in Python uses modularity,
while in Go it uses a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach and command based application.

## How to setup (backend)
### Python
1. see `backend/python/README.md`

### Go
